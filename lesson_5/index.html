							Cyberbullying can happen anywhere with an internet connection. While <a target="_blank" class="girl-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3058261/">traditional, in-person bullying is still more common</a>, data from the <a href="https://cyberbullying.org/facts">Cyberbullying Research Center</a> suggest about 1 in every 4 teens has experienced cyberbullying, and about 1 in 6 has been a perpetrator. About 1 in 5 tweens, or kids ages 9 to 12, has been <a target="_blank" class="girl-link pdf-file" href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://i.cartoonnetwork.com/stop-bullying/pdfs/CN_Stop_Bullying_Cyber_Bullying_Report_9.30.20.pdf">involved in cyberbullying (PDF, 5.57MB)</a>.

							As technology advances, so do opportunities to connect with people—but unfettered access to others isn’t always a good thing, especially for youth. Research has long <a target="_blank" class="girl-link-two" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6214874/">linked more screen time with lower psychological well-being</a>, including higher rates of anxiety and depression. The risk of harm is higher when kids and teens are victimized by cyberbullying.

							Here’s what you need to know about cyberbullying, and psychology’s role in stopping it.

It is “willful and repeated harm inflicted through the use of computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices.” Perpetrators bully victims in any online setting, including social media, video or computer games, discussion boards, or text messaging on mobile devices.
